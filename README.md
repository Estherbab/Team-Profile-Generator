# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
In this challenge I will be creating a team profile generator by using the starter code given to convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. The application will start off by taking in information about employees in a software engineering team(Managers, Engineers and Interns) then will generate a HTML webpage that displays all the summaries for each employee.

# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
In this challenge I will be creating a team profile generator by using the starter code given to convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. The application will start off by taking in information about employees in a software engineering team(Managers, Engineers and Interns) then will generate a HTML webpage that displays all the summaries for each employee.

## Classes
The screenshots below shows the Employee class which is the parent and the children classes(manager, engineer and intern). The manager, engineer, and intern classes will inherit all the behaviours that have been built into the parent class(Employee). The screenshots also show the code that is written to export the Manager, Engineer and Intern Classes.
